## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Backend is Running

The backend is already running on port 3001 with all new features.

### Step 2: Test the Viewer Directly

You can test room-based navigation right now (once you have data):

```
http://localhost:3001/viewer-rooms?propertyId=YOUR_ID
```

### Step 3: Test React App

```bash
# If not already running:
cd /home/nafee-khan/jomi_joma_basha_bari/react_initial_pages
npm start
```

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/upload`

**You'll see:**
1. Step 1: Basic Information
2. Step 2: Add Rooms & Viewpoints (NEW!)
   - Click "Add Your First Room"
   - Enter room name (e.g., "Living Room")
   - Click "Add Viewpoint"
   - Name it (e.g., "Center" or "Entrance")
   - Drag-drop a 360° image
   - Mark as default
   - Add more viewpoints if desired
3. Step 3: Add Hotspots (position navigation arrows)
4. Step 4: Review & Submit

### Step 4: Re-Upload Test Data

Your `test_360_images/` folder still has the images, but you need to:

1. **Create a new property** (via React upload or API)
2. **Create rooms** (Living Room, Kitchen, Master Bedroom)
3. **Upload viewpoints** for each room

I can generate the API commands for you if you want to test quickly via curl.

## 📸 About Test Images

**Q: Do I need to re-upload test images?**  
**A:** Yes, because we reset the database with the new schema.

**Q: Are my images still there?**  
**A:** Yes! Your images in `/home/nafee-khan/jomi_joma_basha_bari/test_360_images/` are still there.

**Q: Can't you upload them for me?**  
**A:** I can create the property and rooms via API, then generate the exact curl commands for you to upload the images. You just need to run those commands.

## 🎯 What You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### Option A: Test with React UI (Easiest)

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/upload`
2. Fill in property details
3. Add rooms and viewpoints using the visual interface
4. Drag-drop your 360° images from `test_360_images/`
5. Submit

### Option B: Quick API Setup (For Testing Viewer)

Want me to:
1. Create a test property via API
2. Create 3 rooms (Living Room, Kitchen, Master Bedroom)
3. Generate upload commands for your 3 images

Then you can immediately test the viewer?

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start?**
- Already running on port 3001! Check with: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`

**React app errors?**
- Run `npm install` in `react_initial_pages/` directory
- Restart with `npm start`

**Viewer shows no rooms?**
- Database was reset - need to re-upload test data
- Or create new property via React UI

**Images not uploading?**
- Make sure you're using 360° equirectangular images
- JPG or PNG format
- Max 50MB per image
